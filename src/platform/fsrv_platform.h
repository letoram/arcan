 * Setup a frameserver that is idle until an external party connects through a
 * listening socket using [key], then behaves as an avfeed- style frameserver.
 * The optional [auth] requires an authentication password before permitting a
 * client to connect. Set [fd] to something other than BADFD(-1) if you have a
 * prepared socket to use (typically in the case of adoption handover during
 * pending listen).
 *
 * To process the resulting arcan_frameserver context, you should first
 * periodically run platform_fsrv_socketpoll() until it returns 0 or
 * -1 with EBADF as errno. On EBADF, the connection point has been consumed
 * and you need to re-allocate.
 *
 * Afterwards, even if you didn't set an auth- key, you should repeat the
 * process with platform_fsrv_socketauth(), with the same kind of error
 * handling.
 *
 * When both these steps have been completed successfully, the frameserver
 * is up and running to the point where normal event processing is working.
