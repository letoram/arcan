 *  - local (non-hostile) network discovery
 *    [pushing packaged appls or state]
 *    [latency sensitive small message passing, e.g. 'netplay']
 *    [design case for working with protective keystore
 *     and crypto usability experiments with curve25519]
 * The current implementation is in a very experimnental state.
