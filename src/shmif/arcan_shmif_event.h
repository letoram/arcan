 *
 *  (borderpx)[tlrd] - indicate a possible border/shadow/decoration area
 *                     that can be cropped away or ignored in position
 *                     calculations.
 *
 *  (parent) (tok)   - can be 0 or the window-id we are relative against,
 *                     useful for popup subsegments etc. tok comes from
 *                     shmif_page segment_token
 *
 *	(invisible)      - hint that the current content segment backing store
 *	                   contains no information that is visibly helpful,
 *	                   this is typically flipped back and forth in order
 *	                   to save connection setup overhead.
 *
 *	(focused)        - Hint that for all the hierarchies in the connection,
 *	                   this is the one that should have the input-focus grab.
 *
 *	(embedded)       - The segment will attach as a part of its parent.
 *	                   This forces the edge to be UL and the segment contents
 *	                   will be clipped against the parent surface.
 *
 *                     Clipping is disabled for Wayland and X11 segment types.
 *
 *                     Scaling hints can be applied for the embedded segment:
 *                     1 : (don't care)
 *                     2 : scale-aspect
 *                     3 : hint-presented
 *                     With hint-presented the segment itself will receive
 *                     display hint with its presentation dimensions, and the
 *                     actual consumed surface will be fed back through
 *                     displayhints.
 *
 *  (anchor-edge)    - enable anchoring to parent.
 *
 *  (anchor-pos)     - enable anchor positioning selection within an area
 *                     in a surface-relative coordinate space.
 *
 *	(edge)           - parent-relative anchoring edge:
 *	                   0 - doesn't matter
 *	                   1 - UL        2 - UC      3 - UR
 *	                   4 - CL        5 - C       6 - CR
 *	                   7 - LL        8 - LC      9 - LR
 *
 *  (x+w, y+h)       - positioning HINT relative to parent UL origo,
 *                     describing the possible anchor region.
 *
 *  (order)          - parent-relative drawing order (+- #segments)
 *
 *  (ext_id)         - Identifier used to specify virtual (tok) when nesting
 *                     windowing systems where it is not useful to have a 1:1
 *                     mapping between segments and 'windows' (x11, win32, ...).
 *
 * Since order is relative to 'parent', the embedding order may be that a
 * negative value will have the effect that 'the child' is visually/hierarchy
 * speaking 'the parent'. The edge case where such a relationship might be
 * expressed is when multiple processes combine to embed one within the other,
 * and the first process controls positioning relative to the second due to
 * a handover allocation.
