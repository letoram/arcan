This directory contains shmif- dependent frameservers, individual
instructions on building and use may apply.

complex/ tries to previde an exhaustive test case for all complex
 window manager operations, ranging from popups, to subwindows,
 viewports, dynamic custom mouse cursors etc.

counter/ provides a simple color cycle in a predictable pattern

counter-ndt/ uses a known color cycle and multi-buffering to test
 how arcan selects buffers in multi-buffer mode

counter-rcv/ used as a recipient for feedcopy or recordtarget
 hooked up to a counter as a provider, checks for dropped or corrupted
 frames

selfdestr/ shuts down after approx 5 seconds, to test how various
 scripts handle termination while something else is active, like
 the global menu or binding bar in durden

clockreq/ needs the corresponding clockreq appl in interactive running
 (use clockreq as connection path) and tests both the builtin clock
 handler for monotonic event delivery and for timers.

gamma/ is used for testing sub-structure negotiation for exposing display
 metadata and (optional) control/manipulation and safe-guards against
 broken table updates.

ioinject/ will attempt to simulate event injection by pressing random keys.
This requires that the running appl explicitly enables it for the specific
connection with the target_flags call. The eventtest interactive test
enables this through the 'eventinjection' connection point.

iodump/ will print out text representations for received input events
 to standard output, working as a simple debugging tool for I/O translation
 and routing.

avlat/ is the software- setup for latency and buffering testing,
 it cycles a number of colors and matching audio tones in response
 to any digital input event, printing CSV timings for synch.
 Audio is a simple sine-wave managed in a separate thread.

initial/ connects and dumps the initial state set during the preroll phase.

migrant/ will connect to the normal CONNPATH, render a number of frames
 in one color channel, migrate or voluntarily pull its *dms and on
 successful reconnection, switch active color channel

tui_test/ attempts to use the shmif_tui library to create a text-
 based user interface

tui_media/ attempts to use the shmif_tui library and its handover
feature to allocate a media window

tui_scroll/ attempts to use the shmif_tui library and content hints
to test server side decorations for scrolling

tpack/ setup a context and replay a preset tpack buffer

handover/ tests the handover feature by connecting, requesting a
 handver subsegment and spawning that into a new process. This also
 works as a stress- test as it will spawn/exec itself without limit.

mousetest/ simply draw a mouse cursor at the last known coordinates.
used to test the shmif- support function for tracking cursor state and
for debugging coordinate translation issues

glcube/ a quick port of robclark/kmscube

btbar/ draw client-side decorated window for testing with
        autocrop inputs and resize

lastword/ test the handling of client provided notifications, alerts
          and the last_words mechanism for conveying a termination
					message.

encfwd/ connect once as an encoder, and then as a normal client that
        forwards what came through the encoder. A 'test' appl is
				included to illustrate the context.


noreg/ tests what happens if a client connects but refuses to register

dbox/ tests dirty updates by moving a 32x32 square +8,+8 with region
      updates every event-clocked frame or reset event

scroll/ tests server side scroll and seeking by exposing CONTENT and
        STREAMSTATUS events.

passthrough/ tests h264 bitstream (with 00 00 00 01) passthrough of
             preencoded video without reencode, use with arcan-net

popup/ test spawning and anchoring a popup on click.
